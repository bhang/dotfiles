A very basic dotfiles setup, along with an install script and some os x settings. 

# Prerequisites

The goal is to reduce the things in this section over time by moving them to the install script. But for now,

* Brave
* 1Password
* Dropbox
* Keybase
* Xcode
* Xcode CLT (`xcode-select --install`)
* Agree to xcode license (`sudo xcodebuild -license accept`)

# Install script / Homebrew

Run install.sh after cloning the repo ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# Additional apps

* Alfred 3 (license/powerpack reqd)
* f.lux
* iStat Menus  (license reqd)
* nvAlt
* Power JSON Editor (license reqd)
* Scroll reverser
* Spectacle
* Slack
